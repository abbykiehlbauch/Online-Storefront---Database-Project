# Introduction

Personality mirroring is a widely developing way of fitting in with friends and/or peers. We have created our company to help with this feeling of not having the same traits as the people around you. You are able to buy personality traits that match with others from our website. Now you can all be the exact same person on the inside! No more feeling lost and wishing you had more friends. 

# Executive Summary

The website we created has an easy to use GUI. With complimenting colors to make each feature simple to see/use. The main page gives an overview of what our website does. The navigation bar is shown on every page so you can always change pages with ease. Since blue is a universal connection of color for every single inhabitant on this planet, we decided to use it as our primary color. 

When you first arrive on the main page, you will see the option to register for an account or login to an existing one. Once you have registered and/or logged in to the website you will see an option to view your account details, past orders or to logout. There is also always the option of going to the home page, viewing products, and viewing your cart. 

Our project has an aesthetically pleasing design, as well as, the design is consistent across all screens. We created the ability to change your entire personality if you wish, or to just change one small thing about yourself. Either way, we hope everyone finds a use for our website. If you know exactly what it is you are in need of, there is an option to search through our traits. There is also an option to sort the traits by categories. 

When you are finishing shopping and you have confirmed your order by viewing your cart, you will need to login with your customer id. This is to ensure there are no issues with your account, and so no one else can submit orders on it. After you sign in and submit your order, it will now show up in your “Past Orders”. 

Once you receive your personality traits, you have the ability to leave a review on each specific trait. While shopping for your traits, these reviews may help you make a decision as to if you should or shouldn’t buy it for yourself.
